To clone the Private Repo and when we dont have https url we have to follow the below steps the keygen steps are in GitLab url

To clone the Private one Repo to another Repo 
----------------------------------------------

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "sangeetha@toco" --- Generate the public and private key

cd /c/Users/SangeethaVasudevan/.ssh/ --- move to the .ssh folder

cat id_ed25519 --- view the private key

cat cat id_ed25519.pub --- View the public key

eval $(ssh-agent -s)

ssh-add id_ed25519

cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts

In GitLab we need to add the generated SSH public key in setting 

Go to preferences of the account --- ssh keys --- add keys --- add the public key.

The private key should be in the Jenkins server which is been generated.

git clone git@10.212.40.4:aiq/sub-aiq-stg01.git

Before that create a directory and do the clone step
you will get the stg directory in the local then clone the destination repo

git clone git@10.212.40.4:aiq/sub-aiq-prd01.git

pwd - Test1 (created folder)

you will get the prd directory in the local cp the contents of the stg to prd directory

cp -r sub-aiq-stg01/* sub-aiq-prd01/

git add .

git commit -m "stgtoprd'

git push
